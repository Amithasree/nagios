Monitoring Remote Server

Monitor your business critical applications running on remote servers.

Required:

1. NRPE installed on the remote machine, which you would like to monitor

2. Active Tcp/Ip 


Start Monitoring:

1. Here i installed docker in my source machine, and i started a container with Ubuntu with NRPE installed.

2. Edit your nrpe.cfg file where ( allowed hosts = 'your remote machine ip, or you can specify ip - address / subnet)

3. Add your own plugins which you would like to monitor on the remote server 



Things will help you troubleshoot:

1. Nagios will listen to port 5666

2. Make sure you have added your remote machine IP to your nrpe.cfg

3. perform check_nrpe -H $HOSTADDRESS$ to verify, the monitor server is connecting to remote server or not.

root@personalworkstation:~/nagios# /usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_nrpe -H <valid ip where NRPE is configured>
NRPE v2.15
root@personalworkstation:~/nagios# /usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_nrpe -H <invalid ip where NRPE is not configured>
connect to address 172.17.0.3 port 5666: No route to host
connect to host 172.17.0.3 port 5666: No route to host

4. Make use of proper Macros's in command.cfg in nagios monotorm server

5. If you see any errors like below

root@personalworkstation:/etc/nagios3# /usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_nrpe -H <valid ip, NRPE configured> -c check_host_ssh_service
CHECK_NRPE: Error - Could not complete SSL handshake. 

   ----> modify your nrpe.cfg to allow remote server ip for handshake
